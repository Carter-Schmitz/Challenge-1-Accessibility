# Challenge-1-Accessibility
Horiseon site accessibilty fixes and general bug fixing.

With changes made to the Horiseon site, all links are now functioning properly. Some elements were also changed in the index file  to semantic elements for ease of use. In the same vein, many of the elements on the CSS have been consolidated through the use of simple, yet descriptive class changes. This will help expedite any future changes and prevent potential bugs due to excessive elements. Possible upcoming changes include the addition of flex boxes to the style sheet, to allow a more universal UX across multiple devices. As well as eventually adding a reset.css sheet to ensure a cohesive appearance across different browsers.
